# PythonDAProject
Learned Exploratory Data Analysis methods throughout semester, from checking missing values to building simple linear regression models.

In this project our task was to build the best predictive model to classify if a loan will carry good or bad credit risks, and we focus on identifying bad risk loans. 

Specifications were using atleast two models that were covered in class, and answer the question whether the past credit history would be an important factor or not.
